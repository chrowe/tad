										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>(This is an expanded version of an article published by <a href="http://www.greenenergytimes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Green Energy Times</a> in their Dec. 2012 issue #17)</em></p>
<p>If you have not heard the term ‘heat pump’ before, you will be soon.  Most people who are familiar with heat pumps associate them with ground-source or ‘geothermal’ systems that move heat from underground into a building using pumped water.  This article is about a much less familiar, less expensive and rapidly growing family of technologies called air source heat pumps (ASHP’s).</p>
<p>Heat pumps are actually quite common and include refrigerators and air conditioners.  They collect heat in one space and deliver it to another through the use of special fluids, a compressor and usually a fan.  The fluids are designed to evaporate within tubes in the space to be cooled, and condense in tubes in the space to be heated, all made possible through certain laws of thermodynamics.<span id="more-839"></span></p>
<p>ASHP’s take advantage of this engineering phenomenon to heat domestic hot water. Over the last few decades they have become very efficient devices that deliver two to three+ times more energy in heat than they consume in electricity.</p>
<div id="attachment_950" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="wp-content/uploads/2013/02/ASHP-DHW-cutaway-copy.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-950" decoding="async" class="wp-image-950 size-medium" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/02/ASHP-DHW-cutaway-copy-300x229.jpg" alt="ASHP DHW cutaway copy" width="300" height="229" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-950" class="wp-caption-text">Stiebel Eltron Accelera 300 Hot Water Heater</p></div>
<p>There are energy companies in Northern New England now who are replacing oil-fired boilers with ASHP’s for space and water heating. The ASHP water heater units are up to seven feet tall and look like a large electric water tank (see image).  They draw heat from the space where they are located and deliver it to the water in the tank, using just over one third of the energy of a standard electric water heater.  The total energy savings is much greater than this, however, because this swap allows a homeowner to turn off their home&#8217;s boiler in the warm months, eliminating the tremendous standby energy losses that happen when an oil boiler runs just to heat a building’s domestic hot water.  It has been estimated that an average homeowner can save 150-200 gallons of heating oil a year by replacing their oil boiler with an ASHP water heater.  At $3.85/gal. for heating oil and a price tag of $1,200 for a cheaper ASHP water heater, the payback period for such a conversion is less than two years.</p>
<p>Another substantial advantage of the ASHP hot water heaters is that they dehumidify the space where they are located.  If this space is a damp basement in which the homeowner often runs a dehumidifier in the summer, the energy efficiency of the whole ASHP system improves from &#8216;great&#8217; to &#8216;fantastic!&#8217;  As with all dehumidifiers, this will result in a water condensate that has to be dealt with.</p>
<p>There are a few disadvantages.  The ASHP water heaters can cost significantly more than conventional hot water systems.  ASHP’s for domestic hot water range from $1,200 to $2,500, but many utilities offer incentives up to $1,000 because of their amazing efficiency.  They are also said to be noisy, though the noise level, as well as the efficiency, varies substantially from unit to unit.  Another disadvantage is that an ASHP takes much longer to heat a tank of water than conventional water heaters do.  Because of this homeowners are often encouraged to buy the larger sized units, which cost more.  ASHP’s are also more complicated and have moving parts that can fail.  Different models also have different warrantees.</p>
<p>Air source heat pumps are not appropriate for every situation.  In the right setting, though, they have the potential to reduce energy usage dramatically.  These systems have been used in Asia and Europe for decades, and with energy prices consistently climbing in America we will be seeing a lot more of them here, too.  In fact, the federal government has all but mandated their use starting in 2015 by increasing the performance standards of water heaters.</p>
<p>In the future we expect these ASHP units to become even more efficient.  For example, warm outdoor air could be ducted to a water heater ASHP to increase its efficiency during warm months.  We can also envision an ASHP water heater being coupled with a refrigerator since they have opposite and complimentary thermal needs.  Likewise, waste ‘coolth’ from an ASHP water heater could be used in the summer to drop the temperature in a root cellar or for the cooling of living spaces.</p>

<div id="attachment_952" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Rosenbaum-HP-Outside.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-952" decoding="async" class="wp-image-952 size-medium" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Rosenbaum-HP-Outside-300x225.jpg" alt="Rosenbaum HP Outside" width="300" height="225" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-952" class="wp-caption-text">Marc Rosenbaum&#8217;s Fujitsu 12RLS single zone ductless &#8216;mini-split&#8217; heat pump (energysmiths.com)</p></div>
<p>Most people either have not heard of an air source heat pump (ASHP) or do not know how common they are. Most of us own one or more already, because they include nearly all refrigerators and air conditioners.</p>
<p><span id="more-825"></span>ASHPs collect heat in one space and deliver it to another through the use of special fluids, a compressor, and usually a fan. The fluids evaporate within tubes in the space to be cooled, and condense in tubes in a space to be heated. We might transfer heat from a house to the outdoors, or the other way around. We also might transfer heat from one part of a house to another in the same way.</p>
<p>The ASHP known as a ductless mini-split is an excellent example. The mini-split is not very large, hence &#8216;mini,&#8217; but it is also divided into two or more components, with a compressor in one place and condensers or evaporators in up to four other places, hence &#8216;split&#8217;. They can serve both as heaters and air conditioners.</p>
<p>The mini-splits have become very efficient devices that deliver two to three+ times more energy in heat than they consume in electricity. Though this might sound like a violation of the laws of physics, they achieve this because the heat is being moved, rather than produced directly from electricity.</p>
<p>A single compressor for an ASHP, usually placed outdoors, might supply heating and/or cooling to as many as four places in the house. This is where the ductless part comes in.  Ducts are often among the worst problems with regard to a building&#8217;s energy efficiency. The ductless mini-split moves liquids instead of gases, and only a short distance.  That is part of the reason why it is so efficient.</p>
<p>There are, of course, down sides. The mini-splits have a minimum temperature rating, dependent on model, and if the outdoor temperature drops below it the heating system switches to conventional electric resistance heating or a backup heating system is required. This minimum temperature varies from unit to unit and can be as low as -10°F. Different models also have different warranties.</p>
<p>Air source heat pumps are not appropriate for every situation. One example is trying to heat a leaky, old Victorian house with an ASHP.  One client of mine wanted this until she learned that five units would be needed at a cost of $25,000.  The first step in such a situation is almost always to button up and insulate, then explore alternative heating systems.</p>
<p>In the right situation mini-splits have the potential to reduce energy usage dramatically while increasing comfort. These systems have been used in Asia and Europe for decades, and now that energy prices are climbing in America we will be seeing a lot more of them here, too.</p>
<div id="attachment_951" style="width: 197px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Rosenbaum-HP-Indoor.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-951" decoding="async" class="wp-image-951 size-medium" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Rosenbaum-HP-Indoor-187x300.jpg" alt="Rosenbaum HP Indoor" width="187" height="300" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-951" class="wp-caption-text">Interior component of Rosenbaum&#8217;s Fujitsu mini-split (above painting)</p></div>
<p>Marc Rosenbaum of Energysmiths installed a mini-split in his 1,600 sq. ft. house on Martha’s Vineyard in 2012 to replace a high efficiency boiler (see photos). He has monitored the system extensively and reports that he reduced his heating energy consumption by 75%. His plan is to install photovoltaic panels at his house in order to cut his reliance on nuclear and fossil fuel. He also installed an ASHP hot water heater, but that will be the subject of a later article.</p>
<p>In the future we expect these ASHP units to become even more efficient. For example, some commercial applications of mini-splits capture heat in one area of a building where cooling is needed and bring that heat to another area where it is needed for space heating.</p>
<p><strong>Rebates: </strong>Efficiency Vermont &amp; PSNH sporadically offer rebates for ASHP’s.  A representative for PSHN queried by <em>Green Energy Times</em> emailed: “For 2013-2014, all 4 (NH) electric utilities proposed heating and cooling system rebates, including a rebate for mini-split / air source heat pumps. We think this technology is extremely efficient and works great with homes heated by Oil or LP FHW (liquid propane forced hot water – eds).” The NH Electric Co-Op offers rebates up to $2,000 for mini-splits. Western Mass. Electric $150-500 for “Central AC/Heat Pump.”  For up-to-date information on rebates and incentives contact <a title="Home Energy Advocates" href="http://www/HomeEnergyAdvocates.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Home Energy Advocates</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Models: </strong>Two ASHP space heater models are Mitsubishi’s ‘Mr. Slim’ and the Fujitsu 12RLS.</p>
