										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #888888;">Here&#8217;s the future of everyday people getting into bicycling.  It&#8217;s beautiful.  Dave Cohen is a psychologist here in Brattleboro with a strong inclination towards connecting people with nature.  We had lunch today and talked about his work pushing the culture shift towards bicycles, especially electrical assist cargo bicycles.  He ran a cargo bike transport business in Berkeley for a bunch of years and has recently gotten Burrows Specialized Sports here in town to carry the <a href="http://yubaride.com/mundo-cargo-bike">Yuba Cargo Bikes</a>.  Later in the day he sent me this video link.<br />
